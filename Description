This project is a Network Packet Analyzer tool built using Python and the Scapy library. 
The tool captures and analyzes real-time network traffic by inspecting various network packet layers.
It extracts key information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol types (TCP, UDP, ICMP), and displays a portion of the packet payload.

The program works on cross-platform environments, including Windows and Linux, and provides 
a foundational understanding of how data packets travel across a network. This is useful 
for monitoring, analyzing, and debugging network issues in real time.

Educational Purpose:
The primary purpose of this program is to serve as a learning tool for students and network enthusiasts to:

Understand the basics of networking protocols and packet structures.

Learn how to capture and inspect network traffic.
Gain insight into how data is transmitted and received over different protocols like TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

The tool also helps in understanding cybersecurity concepts such as traffic analysis, packet filtering, 
and identifying potential vulnerabilities in network communication. It is intended solely for educational purposes and network monitoring in controlled environments.
